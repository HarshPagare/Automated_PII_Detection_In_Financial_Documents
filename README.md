# Automated_PII_Detection_In_Financial_Documents
The concept of this work is to propose a hybrid approach that will involve the use of machine learning and N.L.P. in the search for PII in financial documents, which is very vital in enhancing data security and ensuring privacy in financial environments where private information is often released. First, creating a training dataset must include the exact positioning of PII within the text, which has to be thoroughly annotated. Thus, the model learns from this dataset, combining machine learning algorithms with rule-based natural language processing approaches that significantly enhance the accuracy. Later, the trained model was tested on the generated testing dataset to evaluate the performance of the metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and overall accuracy. Further anonymization methods are applied to the discovered PII to make sure that privacy is protected, but not at the cost of the integrity of the original text. Several visualization evaluation methods, such as confusion matrices, R.O.C. curves, and precision-recall curves, were tried for insight into the model's performance. The overall accuracy and precision values come out to be 0.8939 and 0.9470, respectively. These findings prove that the hybrid model contributes to the betterment of data security in sectors dealing with sensitive information, as it offers an efficient method for PII detection in financial documents. 

The results of this work have been submitted to the Results in Engineering Journal and the research paper is currently under review.
